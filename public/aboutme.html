            Hello there! I'm Taruna Dhaddha, a 19-year-old currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at VIT Vellore. Passionate about technology and its endless possibilities, I dive into the world of coding and problem-solving with enthusiasm. My journey in the realm of CS has been a fascinating exploration of creativity and logical thinking. Beyond the lines of code, I find joy in exploring new ideas, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and continuously learning to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape. Join me on this exciting adventure as I turn ideas into reality, one keystroke at a time!
